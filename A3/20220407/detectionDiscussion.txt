The model performance are the following:

gru, hidden size 5 and learning rate of 1e-4: Model test accuracy: 0.323
gru, hidden size 10 and learning rate of 1e-4: Model test accuracy: 0.355
gru, hidden size 50 and learning rate of 1e-4: Model test accuracy: 0.581


gru, hidden size 5 and learning rate of 1e-2: Model test accuracy: 0.323
gru, hidden size 10 and learning rate of 1e-2: Model test accuracy: 0.387
gru, hidden size 50 and learning rate of 1e-2: Model test accuracy: 0.323

gru, hidden size 5 and learning rate of 1e0: Model test accuracy: 0.226
gru, hidden size 10 and learning rate of 1e0: Model test accuracy: 0.258
gru, hidden size 50 and learning rate of 1e0: Model test accuracy: 0.258

Yes there is a trend in the hidden size where the bigger the hidden sizes the higher the accuracy. However this trend is only observed at smaller learning rate, for learning rate of 1e-2 and 1e0, this trend does not occur.

It can also be observed that smaller learning rate tend to perform better than larger ones.
