Using Google's online transcription service:

For the word I tried "potatoes" and it outputted "potatoes", which means it worked very well. 

For the one short sentence I tried "I want to eat pig brains right now" and it outputted "I want to eat pig brains right now", which is also 100% accurate. 

For a longer sentence, I tried reading "It reached number one on the Oricon chart and sold two million copies, being certified by the RIAJ", and it outputted 
"It reached number one on the Oricon chart and sold two million copies being certified by D R I H A". It got almost everything correct other than the word "the" was outputted as letter "D" and the letter "J" was outputted as "HA".

I spoke these sentences into my phone, recorded it and used them on Google's voice search. The ASR performed very well for short sentences and the and word with 100% auccracy. For the longer sentence read slowly it only 
got two words incorrect, so it still performed well overall.
