My hypothesis was that I expected to see an increase to accuracy as the sample numbers increase. This is because an increase
in sample numbers would mean the model is able to generalize better since it is trained on more training dats. 
There is less chance of overrfiting to small amount of dataset that is not representative of the entire population.
There are more cases the model is able to see now that it would have not been exposed to with less samples.
I do observe this hypothesized trend on this result.
