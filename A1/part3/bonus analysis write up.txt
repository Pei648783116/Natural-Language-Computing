For the bonus part I did hyper-parameter searches on all the classifiers to see if it can increase the accuracy of the classifies. Since most of these classifiers just started with the default value on most of these hyper-parameters, there is definitely room for improvement. With enough runtime allocated, I would perform grid search. However, since the CDF cluster is running very slowly I have chosen 15 random searches for each classifier for this assignment. Compare the output from the bonus to the result from part 3_1, indeed the performance of the classifiers were increased.
